                <p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Clay, was a legendary boxer known for his charisma, skill, and activism. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1960 and became the world heavyweight champion in 1964 by defeating Sonny Liston. Famous for his quick footwork and powerful jabs, Ali defended his title multiple times. His career highlights include the "Fight of the Century" against Joe Frazier and the "Rumble in the Jungle" victory over George Foreman. Ali was stripped of his title in 1967 for refusing the Vietnam War draft but regained it later. He retired in 1981 and remains a global icon. </p>
